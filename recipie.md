Directions
 1) Preheat oven to 375Â°. Separate tubes of dough into 8 rolls each; halve the rolls. Press dough onto the bottom and up the sides of miniature muffin cups coated with cooking spray.

 2) Spoon pizza sauce into each cup. Sprinkle with onion, green pepper, pepperoni and cheese. Bake until the crusts are browned and cheese is melted, 15-18 minutes.
